#
# Global values 
#

# 
# log - select a mechanism for logging fido 
# daemon information. The choices are syslog
# or a path to a file.
#
# example: log = /var/log/fido.log
#
log      = syslog

#
# pid - the location of the fido pid file. This
# is helpful for auxillary scripts that start and
# stop the daemon. This distribution includes a 
# redhat startup script inside the utils directory.
#
# example: pid = /var/run/fido.pid
#
pid      = /var/run/fido.pid

#
# daemon - instructs fido to run in the background 
# 'true' or in the foreground 'false'. 
# 
# example: daemon = false
#
daemon   = true

#
# vebose - if true, this instructs fido to print debugging 
# information to stdout. It's only useful to set this to 
# true when running the program in the foreground (daemon = false)
# 
# example: verbose = true
#
verbose  = false

#
# rulesdir - this directive tells fido where to look for its
# rules files. If you set it to '/etc/fido/rules' and set 
# rules = haha.conf in a file block, then fido will look for 
# that file's rules in /etc/fido/rules/haha.conf
#
# exmaple: rulesdir = /usr/local/etc/fido/rules
#
rulesdir = /etc/fido/rules

#
# user - instructs fido to run as a specified users. If this 
# directive isn't set, then fido will run as the user who 
# who invoked the daemon.
#
# example: user = jdfulmer
#
# user = root

#
# group - instructs fido to run with specified group ownership. 
# If this directive isn't set, then fido will run user the primary 
# group of the user who invoked the daemon.
#
# example: group = jdfulmer
#
# group = wheel

#
# SAMPLE FILE BLOCKS
#

#
# This configuration runs an action if the file is 
# modified, i.e., it's modification time changes.
#
# /data/ftpd/pub/upload.txt {
#   rules  = modified
#   action = echo "upload.txt was modified" | sendmail -v jeff@haha.com
#   log    = /home/jdfulmer/var/my.log
# }

#
# This configuration executes an action if any file
# inside the /export directory is older than 7 days
# as long as that file does NOT begin with . nor is
# it named CVS or Makefile. If recure is true, then
# fido will search subdirectories. 
#
# /export {
#   rules   = exceeds 7 days
#   exclude = ^\.|CVS|Makefile
#   action  = /usr/local/bin/sendtrap.sh
#   recurse = true
# }

#
# This configuration runs an action if OutOfMemoryError 
# suddenly appears in the log file
# 
# /var/log/jboss/catalina.out {
#   rules  = .*OutOfMemoryError.*
#   action = /usr/local/bin/sendtrap.sh
#   log    = syslog
# }

#
# This configuration runs an action if any of the 
# patterns contained in /etc/fido/rules/apache.conf 
# is suddenly matched.
#
# /var/log/httpd/access_log {
#  rules  = apache.conf
#  action = /usr/local/bin/sendpage.sh
# }
